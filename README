README
=====
This program provides a linux equivalent of the Pharos Remote Printing Package available for Windows and Macintosh clients. This package will install a new CUPS backend that will allow printing to lpd queues on the pharos uniprint print server. Also it will install a new pharos popup server that will allow for users to input their printing ID's to be tied with the print jobs they send. This will allow the users to use their printing ID's to release the print jobs at the pharos release stations.

PRE-REQUISITES
==============
1. CUPS printing system
	Most linux distributions use CUPS printing by default. To check if CUPS is running open a web browser and go to http://localhost:631
	This should launch the CUPS printing interface.
	
2. wxPython library
	This python library is required to display popups used for printing to pharos printing queues.
	To verify if wxpython is installed
	a. Open terminal
	b. Run python interactive shell
	   >python
	c. Try to import the wxpython module
	   >>import wx
	d. If you do not get any error message, then wxpython is installed.

3. Printer Drivers
	Your desktop should have all the required drivers that are mentioned in the printers.conf file. If the printer driver defined in the configuration file is not found then that printer will not be installed. The printers.conf file is located in the same directory as this README file.

On systems with selinux enabled (Red Hat and derivatives). you will need to disable selinux or setup policies in order for the popup application to work correctly. Please refer to the corresponding systems administration guide to disable selinux.
